# Guessing Game Program

 ## Overview
This is a simple C++ program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The game will continue to prompt the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed. The program also provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it tracks the number of attempts it takes to get the correct guess.

## Features
- Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number using the C++ standard library.
- Continuous Play: The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. Each incorrect guess prompts the user to try again.
- Feedback: After each guess, the program will tell the user if their guess was too high or too low.
- Attempt Counter: The program keeps track of how many guesses it takes for the user to guess the correct number and displays this count at the end of the game.
